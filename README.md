# Infraslow-MEG-waves

This repository houses the code for the infraslow MEG waves machine learning project.


To run this project, set up a virtual environment (this project uses Python 3.7.4).
After the environment is set up, activate it in command line with either:

```env\Scripts\activate``` (Windows)


```source env/bin/activate``` (Linux)

Then run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to get the proper versions of the modules used in this project.

Any algorithms that have a random component to them (i.e. ExtraTrees) were set with a seed, so that results can be reproduced.

If you would like to reproduce the results of this project, please message me for the datasets used.
